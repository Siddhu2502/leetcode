# Intuition
The problem seems to be about detecting a cycle in a singly-linked list. The key insight here is to use two pointers: one slow pointer that advances one step at a time and a fast pointer that advances two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer, indicating the presence of a cycle.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both starting at the head of the linked list.
2. Traverse the linked list with `fast` moving two steps at a time and `slow` moving one step at a time.
3. If there is a cycle, `fast` will eventually catch up to `slow`, and we return True.
4. If `fast` reaches the end of the linked list (i.e., `fast` or `fast.next` becomes None), we return False because there is no cycle.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  - In the worst case, we need to traverse the entire linked list, where n is the number of nodes in the list.
- Space complexity: O(1)
  - We are using only a constant amount of additional space for the two pointers, `fast` and `slow`.


# Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            head = head.next 
            fast = fast.next.next
            if head == fast:
                return True
        return False
```
