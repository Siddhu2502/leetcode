## Intuition
The problem seems to involve reversing the order of words in a given string. The intuition behind this approach might be splitting the input string into individual words, reversing the order of these words, and then joining them back together to form the final reversed string.

## Approach
The approach outlined in the given code involves the following steps:
1. Split the input string `s` into individual words using whitespace as a delimiter. This can be achieved using the `split()` function.
2. Create a list called `reversed_words` that contains the words from `words` list in reverse order. This can be achieved using the `reversed()` function.
3. Join the words in the `reversed_words` list back together into a single string using whitespace as the separator. This can be done using the `join()` function.
4. Return the final reversed string.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The algorithm involves splitting the input string and then joining the words. Both of these operations take linear time with respect to the length of the input string. Reversing the list of words also takes linear time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the input string.
- **Space complexity**: The algorithm uses additional space to store the list of words, the reversed list of words, and the final output string. The space used is proportional to the length of the input string. Therefore, the space complexity is **O(n)**.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Split the input string into individual words
        words = s.split()
        
        # Reverse the order of words
        reversed_words = list(reversed(words))
        
        # Join the reversed words back into a string
        outstring = ' '.join(reversed_words)
        
        return outstring
```
