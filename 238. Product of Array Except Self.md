## Intuition
The problem appears to involve finding an array where each element at index `i` is the product of all the elements in the original array except the element at index `i`. The intuition behind this approach might be to calculate the prefix products and suffix products for each element and then combine them to get the desired result.

## Approach
The approach outlined in the given code involves the following steps:
1. Initialize an array `products_array` of the same length as the input `nums` to store the product values.
2. Loop through the array `nums` and calculate the prefix products up to each element. Store these prefix products in the `products_array` as you iterate through the array.
3. Initialize a variable `right_num` to store the product of elements on the right side. Start with the last element of `nums`.
4. Loop through the array in reverse order, calculating the suffix products and updating the elements in the `products_array` with the combined prefix and suffix product.
5. Return the `products_array` containing the desired products.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The algorithm goes through the array twice: once for calculating prefix products and once for calculating suffix products. Both of these loops run in linear time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the input array.
- **Space complexity**: The algorithm uses additional space to store the `products_array` of the same length as the input array. Hence, the space complexity is **O(n)**.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        length = len(nums)
        products_array = [1]*length
        
        # Calculate prefix products
        for i in range(1, length):
            products_array[i] = nums[i-1] * products_array[i-1]
        
        # Calculate suffix products and combine with prefix products
        right_num = nums[-1]
        for i in range(length-2, -1, -1):
            products_array[i] *= right_num
            right_num *= nums[i]
        
        return products_array
