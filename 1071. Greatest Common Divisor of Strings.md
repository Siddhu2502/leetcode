## Intuition
The problem seems to involve finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of two strings `str1` and `str2`, and then extracting a substring from `str1` of that length. The intuition behind this approach might be based on the observation that if there exists a non-empty GCD string between `str1` and `str2`, then it can be constructed by repeating a certain substring multiple times.

## Approach
The approach outlined in the given code involves the following steps:
1. Check whether it's possible to form a non-empty GCD string between `str1` and `str2` by concatenating them in both orders (`str1 + str2` and `str2 + str1`). If these concatenated strings are not equal, it means no non-empty GCD string exists, so return an empty string.
2. If the concatenated strings are equal, it indicates that there exists a GCD string between the two strings. Proceed to find the length of the GCD string by computing the GCD of the lengths of `str1` and `str2` using the `gcd()` function.
3. Return a substring of `str1` with a length equal to the calculated GCD.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: The algorithm involves performing string concatenation twice, which takes linear time with respect to the lengths of `str1` and `str2`. Computing the GCD using the `gcd()` function also takes constant time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m)**, where n is the length of `str1` and m is the length of `str2`.
- Space complexity: The algorithm uses additional space for string concatenation and the substring result. The space complexity is **O(n + m)**, where n is the length of `str1` and m is the length of `str2`.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    
    def gcdOfStrings(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        # Check if they have non-zero GCD string.
        if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1:
            return ""

        # Get the GCD of the two lengths.
        max_length = gcd(len(str1), len(str2))
        return str1[:max_length]
