## Intuition
The problem appears to involve reversing the vowels in a given string. The intuition behind this approach seems to be using two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the string and the other starting from the end. These pointers move towards each other, swapping vowel characters they encounter until they meet in the middle.

## Approach
The approach outlined in the given code involves the following steps:
1. Create a list of vowel characters.
2. Convert the input string into a list of characters for easier manipulation.
3. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` starts from the beginning of the string and `j` starts from the end.
4. While `i` is less than `j`, iterate through the string:
   - If both characters at `i` and `j` are vowels, swap them and move both pointers closer to the center.
   - If the character at `i` is a vowel and the character at `j` is not, decrement `j` to move towards the center.
   - If the character at `j` is a vowel and the character at `i` is not, increment `i` to move towards the center.
   - If neither character at `i` nor `j` is a vowel, increment `i` and decrement `j` to continue searching for vowels.
5. Finally, convert the modified list of characters back to a string and return it.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The algorithm iterates through the input string once using two pointers. In the worst case, each character of the string is checked once, resulting in a linear time complexity of **O(n)**, where n is the length of the input string.
- **Space complexity**: The algorithm uses additional space to store the list of characters, which is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity can be considered as **O(1)** if we disregard the space used for the input and output.

The provided code appears to be correct and follows the described approach for reversing vowels in a string.

# Code
```
class Solution:
    def reverseVowels(self,s):
        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
        s_list = list(s)
        i = 0
        j = len(s) - 1
        while i < j:
            # if both the values are found swap them
            if s_list[i] in vowels and s_list[j] in vowels:
                s_list[i], s_list[j] = s_list[j], s_list[i]
                i += 1
                j -= 1
            # if the left most found and right most not yet found use the point of that index
            elif s_list[i] in vowels:
                j -= 1
            # if the right most found and the left most not yet found then use this pointer to store that index
            elif s_list[j] in vowels:
                i += 1
            # if neither character is a vowel, move both pointers
            else:
                i += 1
                j -= 1
        # convert the list back to a string and return it
        return ''.join(s_list)
