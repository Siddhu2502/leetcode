# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem appears to be about determining whether one string `s` is a subsequence of another string `t`.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to 0. These pointers will be used to traverse the characters of the strings `s` and `t`.
2. While both pointers are within their respective string bounds (`i < len(s)` and `j < len(t)`):
   - If the current character in `s` at index `i` matches the current character in `t` at index `j`, increment `i` by 1 to move to the next character in `s`.
   - Always increment `j` by 1 to move to the next character in `t`.
3. After the loop, if `i` is equal to the length of `s`, it means that all characters in `s` have been found as a subsequence in `t`, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(min(len(s), len(t)))
  - The code iterates through both strings once, and the number of iterations is limited by the length of the shorter string.
- Space complexity: O(1)
  - The code uses a constant amount of extra space for variables regardless of the input sizes.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        i, j = 0, 0  # Initialize two pointers to traverse the strings.
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1
        
        return i == len(s)  # Check if all characters in s were found in t.
