# Intuition
The problem appears to be about moving all the non-zero elements to the beginning of a given list while preserving the order of non-zero elements.

# Approach
1. Initialize an index variable `index` to 0.
2. Iterate through the input `nums` list.
   - If the current element `nums[i]` is non-zero:
     - Swap `nums[i]` with the element at index `index`. This effectively moves non-zero elements to the beginning of the list.
     - Increment the `index`.
3. After the loop, all non-zero elements are moved to the beginning of the list, and the order of non-zero elements is preserved.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  - The code iterates through the input `nums` list once, where `n` is the length of the input list.
- Space complexity: O(1)
  - The code uses a constant amount of extra space for variables regardless of the input size.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        index = 0  # Initialize an index variable to keep track of non-zero elements.
       
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != 0:
                # If the current element is non-zero, swap it with the element at index.
                # This effectively moves non-zero elements to the beginning of the list.
                nums[i], nums[index] = nums[index], nums[i]
                index += 1
